  /**
   * Class that listens for changes (additions or removals) to
   * "flattened nodes" on a given `node`. The list of flattened nodes consists
   * of a node's children and, for any children that are `<slot>` elements,
   * the expanded flattened list of `assignedNodes`.
   * For example, if the observed node has children `<a></a><slot></slot><b></b>`
   * and the `<slot>` has one `<div>` assigned to it, then the flattened
   * nodes list is `<a></a><div></div><b></b>`. If the `<slot>` has other
   * `<slot>` elements assigned to it, these are flattened as well.
   *
   * The provided `callback` is called whenever any change to this list
   * of flattened nodes occurs, where an addition or removal of a node is
   * considered a change. The `callback` is called with one argument, an object
   * containing an array of any `addedNodes` and `removedNodes`.
   *
   * Note: the callback is called asynchronous to any changes
   * at a microtask checkpoint. This is because observation is performed using
   * `MutationObserver` and the `<slot>` element's `slotchange` event which
   * are asynchronous.
